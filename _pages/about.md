About me
======
Hey! Thanks for visiting! I'm currently a Master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/), focusing on Data Management System track, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/). 

Before starting my Master's program, I received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2022 with honors.

Research Interest
======
My research interests mainly focus on systems and computer architecture, including parallel and distributed computing, memory architecture and any other tools that help improve the efficiency of data management and processing. Iâ€™m also open to broader topics, such as heterogeneous systems and systems for machine learning.
