About me
======
Hey! Thanks for visiting! I'm currently a Master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/), focusing on Data Management System track, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/). 

Before starting my Master's program, I received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2022 with honors.
