About me
======
Thanks for visiting! I'm currently a Master's student at **[ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/)**, focusing on Data Management System track, where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Michal Friedman](https://sites.google.com/view/michalf) and Prof. [Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/). Before starting my Master's program, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (**[HUST](https://hust.edu.cn/)**) in 2022 with honors.

<span style="color:#fe9c7a">**I'm actively seeking a PhD position in systems and modern hardware, so feel free to take a look at my [CV](/files/CV_HangHu.pdf) :ï¼‰**</span>


Research Interests
======
My research focuses on optimizing **data management and processing systems** through advances in **parallel and distributed computing**, **memory architecture**, and **hardware accelerators**. I aim to develop tools that benefit programming and improve both performance and energy efficiency in heterogeneous architectures. I'm also open to broader topics such as systems for machine learning.

Currently, I am working on the persistence management of cache-coherent data structures on the heterogeneous architecture.
